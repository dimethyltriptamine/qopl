how to make programming languages.

## Variables

* Global variables are declared with the keyword `lsd`, because LSD
allows you to see what's happening everywhere, and makes your mind go
everywhere, like a global variable.

* Constants are declared with the keyword `thc`, because once you
  smoke a joint, it will take a lot for the thc to leave your body and
  nothing will change that.

## Control flow

if:
unless:
while:
until:
for:


## Planned thigns

* hash tables (declared with the keyword `hashish`)
* arrays (double linked circular linked lists) (declared with keyword
  `joint`)

## Unplanned things

Object oriented interface, but if anything, classes will be declared
with the `scopolamine` keyword, because that's something no one would
enjoy.
